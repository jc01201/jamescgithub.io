# The Simplest Web Site Ever

This is the most basic HTML and CSS site you will ever see. You can use it to customize your own site, and make it better over time.

← `index.html`: Edit this file and add content and HTML tags like <h1>Headlines</h1>, <p>paragraphs</p>, <b>bold characters</b>, and other tags you learn about at Codeacademy or W3Schools.

← `style.css`: Edit this file to control how your headlines, paragraphs, body text, etc. look visually.
